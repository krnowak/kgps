dec functions are wrong (they do ++ instead of --)

maybe add color output to test.sh
  - needs to detect the terminal output, we don't want color when
    piping things

make splitter a bit smarter about the before and after context
  - safest thing to do is to put the before context in the same
    section as the first changed line
  - same for after context and the section for the last changed line
  - make the above unnecessary

when generating location markers, skip the line count if it is 1

rename the basic test to something with location markers

add a separate test for the big gnome patch?

compare the splitter-generated patches with the git-format-generated
patches to see if for example line markers are correct

make regexes more robust by matching the trailing whitespace. strip the whitespace.

drop this TODO, move the issues to github
