patch-splitter
==============

`split.pl` reads a given file being a git patch with some additional
annotations, slices it into several other patches (writes them to
files) and writes a file being a list of generated patches and commit
messages. Annotations are simply comments with some structure.

Usage:
- `split.pl ANNOTATED_GIT_PATCH`

`process_patches_list.sh` reads a file list generated by split.pl and
applies them to git repo.

Usage:
- `process_patches_list.sh <patches.list`
